When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Since, I work in multiple computers so its a heckle to take programs everytime in pendrive.
So I would just update all of my work to the remote repository except very small ones which I can complete in one sitting.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would like to decide when my repository gets public rather than github doing it all the time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone to copy from my github account to local computer. Branch to create new branch to wok on something different or bug fix or feature adding. I would use fork to copy my favourite repositories from different people in github to my git hub account.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Now that I have learnt to use github, it seems a really good way to collaborate. Unless I am meeting the other person regularly, its really convenient to use github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I would be able to work more independently and I could also do some experimental work.
