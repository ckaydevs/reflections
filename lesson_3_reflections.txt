When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Since, I work in multiple computers so its a heckle to take programs everytime in pendrive.
So I would just update all of my work to the remote repository except very small ones which I can complete in one sitting.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would like to decide when my repository gets public rather than github doing it all the time.
