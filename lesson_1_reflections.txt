How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see
the bug that was introduced?

It was very helpful as I didn't have to go through the whole file and since the
difference was detailed in so structured way that fault finding became quite easy.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Fault finding or typos would be easy to find.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pro of manual commit is that I can create valuable checkpoints. 
Con of manual commit is that if I forget to save somehow or if the system breaks down then all changes would be lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In google docs multifle files are normal files and not programs. so they are not interconnected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

To check the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

it would be very convenient as with only one command i can return back to my older commits. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

learn sql
